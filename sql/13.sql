/*
 * Management wants to create a "best sellers" list for each actor.
 *
 * Write a SQL query that:
 * For each actor, reports the three films that the actor starred in that have brought in the most revenue for the company.
 * (The revenue is the sum of all payments associated with that film.)
 *
 * HINT:
 * For correct output, you will have to rank the films for each actor.
 * My solution uses the `rank` window function.
