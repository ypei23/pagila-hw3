 * In the previous query, the actors could come from any combination of movies.
 * Unfortunately, you've found that if the actors all come from only 1 or 2 of the movies,

 * at least 1 actor was also in AMERICAN CIRCUS,
 * at least 1 actor was also in ACADEMY DINOSAUR,
 * and at least 1 actor was also in AGENT TRUMAN.
 *
 * HINT:
 * There are many ways to solve this problem,
 * but I personally found the INTERSECT operator to make a convenient solution.
